<h2>
    The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken down into sub-problems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention.

<h3>
    Reasoning, problem-solving
</h3>
<h2>
    Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions.[44] By the late 1980s and 1990s, AI research had developed methods for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.[45]<br><br>

    Many of these algorithms proved to be insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experienced a "combinatorial explosion": they became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger.[46] Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.[47]

<h3>
    Knowledge representation
</h3>
<h2>
Knowledge representation and knowledge engineering[48] allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts.<br><br>
A representation of "what exists" is an ontology: the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties formally described so that software agents can interpret them.[49] The most general ontologies are called upper ontologies, which attempt to provide a foundation for all other knowledge and act as mediators between domain ontologies that cover specific knowledge about a particular knowledge domain (field of interest or area of concern). A truly intelligent program would also need access to commonsense knowledge; the set of facts that an average person knows. The semantics of an ontology is typically represented in description logic, such as the Web Ontology Language.[50]

<h2>
AI research has developed tools to represent specific domains, such as objects, properties, categories and relations between objects;[50] situations, events, states and time;[51] causes and effects;[52] knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);.[53] default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing); [54] as well as other domains. Among the most difficult problems in AI are: the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the number of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous);[55] and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as "facts" or "statements" that they could express verbally).[47]<br><br>
Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval,[56] scene interpretation,[57] clinical decision support,[58] knowledge discovery (mining "interesting" and actionable inferences from large databases),[59] and other areas.[60]

<h3>
    Learning
</h3>
<h2>
Machine learning (ML), a fundamental concept of AI research since the field's inception,[j] is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.[k]<br><br>
<abbr title="Unsupervised learning is a type of algorithm that learns patterns from untagged data. The goal is that through mimicry, which is an important mode of learning in people, the machine is forced to build a concise representation of its world and then generate imaginative content from it.">Unsupervised learning</abbr> finds patterns in a stream of input. Supervised learning requires a human to label the input data first, and comes in two main varieties: classification and numerical regression. Classification is used to determine what category something belongs in – the program sees a number of examples of things from several categories and will learn to classify new inputs. Regression is the attempt to produce a function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should change as the inputs change. Both classifiers and regression learners can be viewed as "function approximators" trying to learn an unknown (possibly implicit) function; for example, a spam classifier can be viewed as learning a function that maps from the text of an email to one of two categories, "spam" or "not spam".[64] In reinforcement learning the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent classifies its responses to form a strategy for operating in its problem space.[65] Transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem.[66]<br><br>
Computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity, by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization.[67]<br><br>

<h3>Natural language processing</h3>
<h2>Natural language processing (NLP)[68] allows machines to read and understand human language. A sufficiently powerful natural language processing system would enable natural-language user interfaces and the acquisition of knowledge directly from human-written sources, such as newswire texts. Some straightforward applications of NLP include information retrieval, question answering and machine translation.[69]</h2>

<h2>
    Symbolic AI used formal syntax to translate the deep structure of sentences into logic. This failed to produce useful applications, due to the intractability of logic[46] and the breadth of commonsense knowledge.[55] Modern statistical techniques include co-occurrence frequencies (how often one word appears near another), "Keyword spotting" (searching for a particular word to retrieve information), transformer-based deep learning (which finds patterns in text), and others.[70] They have achieved acceptable accuracy at the page or paragraph level, and, by 2019, could generate coherent text.
</h2>
<h3>Perception</h3>
<h2>
    Machine perception[72] is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, and active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors) to deduce aspects of the world. Applications include speech recognition,[73] facial recognition, and object recognition.[74] Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input.[75]

<h2>
    Affective computing is an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process or simulate human feeling, emotion and mood.[77] For example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction. However, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of how intelligent existing computer agents actually are.[78] Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal sentiment analysis), wherein AI classifies the affects displayed by a videotaped subject.[79]

<h2>
    A machine with general intelligence can solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence. There are several competing ideas about how to develop artificial general intelligence. Hans Moravec and Marvin Minsky argue that work in different individual domains can be incorporated into an advanced multi-agent system or cognitive architecture with general intelligence.[80] Pedro Domingos hopes that there is a conceptually straightforward, but mathematically difficult, "master algorithm" that could lead to AGI.[81] Others believe that anthropomorphic features like an artificial brain[82] or simulated child development[l] will someday reach a critical point where general intelligence emerges.
